[Bm]The club isn't the best p[Em]lace to find a lover so the b[G]ar is where I g[A]o
[Bm]Me and my friends at the [Em]table doing shots, drinking f[G]ast and then we talk slo[A]w

  Although my [Em]heart is falling [G]too
  I'm in l[A]ove with your body
[Bm]  And last n[Em]ight you were in my r[G]oom

[Bm]One week in we let the[Em] story begin
We're going [G]out on our first d[A]ate
But you and [Bm]me are thrifty so go[Em] all you can eat
Fill up your [G]bag and I fill up a p[A]late
We talk for [Bm]hours and hours about the [Em]sweet and the sour
And how your [G]family is doin' ok[A]ay
And leave and [Bm]get in a taxi, we [Em]kiss in the backseat
Tell the d[G]river make the radio pl[A]ay, and I'm singing like
