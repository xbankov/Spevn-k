A l[Dm]ong ass fuckin' time ago, In a town called Kickapoo,
There l[Am]ived a humble family, Religious through and through.
But y[F]ay there was a black sheep, And he kn[C]ew just what to do.[G]

His n[Dm]ame was young J.B., and he refused to step in-line.
A [Am]vision he did see-th, Fucking rocking all the time.
He wr[F]ote a tasty jam, And all the pla[C]nets did alig[G]n.

And [G]if you try to fuck with me, Then [Bb]I shall fuck you t[A]oo!

You've [G5]disobeyed my orders son, Why w[Bb5]ere you ever born?
Your b[F5]rother's ten times better than you, J[G#5]esus loves him more.
This [G5]music that you play for us Comes [Bb5]from the depths of hell.
R[F5]ock and roll's the devil's work, He w[G#5]ants you to rebel.
You'll [G5]become a mindless puppet; Beelze[Bb5]bub will pull the strings!
Your [F5]heart will lose direction, And ch[G#5]aos it will br[G5]ing.

[Bb]You'd better shut your [F]mouth, You better watch your tone[G5]![C5][G5][C5][G5]
You're g[Bb]rounded for a w[F]eek with no telephon[G5]e![C5][G5][C5][G5]
D[Bb]on't let me hear you cr[F]y, Don't let me hear you moa[G5]n![C5][G5][C5][G5]
Y[Bb]ou gotta praise The L[F]ord when you're in my home[G5]![C5][G5][C5][G5]

D[G]io can you hear me? I am lo[Bb]st and so alone...
I'm [F]askin' for your guidance, Won't you co[G#]me down from your throne?    
I ne[G]ed a tight compadre Who will te[Bb]ach me how to rock.    
My F[F]ather thinks you're evil, But man, h[G#]e can suck a cock.   
R[G]ock is not the devil's work, It's ma[Bb]gical and rad.  
I'll n[F]ever rock as long as I am Stu[G#]ck here with my Da[G]d...



[G5] [Bb5]  [F5] [G#5] 



I [C5]hear you brave young Jables, You are h[C5]ungry for the rock.
But to [C5]learn the ancient method, Sacred d[Bb5]oors you must unlock.  
Es[C5]cape your father's clutches, On this [C5]oppressive neighborhood.                 
On a j[C5]ourney you must go, To find the [Bb5]land of Hollywood[C5]!    

In The C[C5]ity of Fallen Angels, Where the[F5] ocean meets the[G#5] sand,   
You will f[C5]orm a strong alliance, And the w[F5]orld's most awesome [G#5]band!    
To f[C5]ind your fame and fortune, Through the [F5]valley you must [G#5]walk.   
You will f[C5]ace your inner demons. Now [F5]go my [G#5]son and [G5]rock!

So he [G5]bailed from fuckin' Kickapoo With hunger in his heart.
And he [D5]journeyed far and wide To find the secrets of his art
But [Bb5]in the end he knew That he would [C5]find his counterpart.
