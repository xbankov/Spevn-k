{title: Lower your expectations}

[Verse]

[E]You want a guy that's sweet
A guy that's to[C#m]ugh
[C#m]A feminist who likes to pay for [A]stuff

The kinda guy that gets along with your friends

Without be[B]ing attracted to any of them
[E]A good boy, a bad boy, a good bad [C#m]boy
                          
A half good half bad half boy
[A]Loves your brother sensitive but not weak and
[B]Is a great lover calls your mother on the weekend
[E]Then you might thin[A]k that this guy onl[B]y exists i[C#m]n your[A] mind
Well guess w[E]hat
[B]You're right

[Chorus]

[E]If you want love[C#m][A]
[B]Lower your expectation[E]s a few[C#m]
Cause Prince C[A]harming would never se[B]ttle for you
If y[E]ou want l[C#m]ove[A]
[B]Just pick a guy and l[E]ove him
[C#m]And if he's got a thing for[A] feet
Say fuck it, [B]sweep me off them

[Verse]

[E]You want a girl that's nice
A girl that's [C#m]not
[C#m]Obsessed with her looks but is insanely[A] hot

The kinda girl that you can show to your folks

Loves the m[B]ovies that you like and always laughs at your jokes
[E]A real girl, a hot girl, a really hot g[C#m]irl

A brand new really hot real doll

[A]Wants to impress you doesn't care if you notice
And o[B]nly ever uses you to tickle her throat with

[tab][ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]     [ch]B[/ch]              [ch]C#m[/ch]   [ch]A[/ch]

Then you might think that this girl only exists in your mind[/tab]
[E]She's real
But last [B]week
She died

[Chorus]

[E]If you want love[C#m][A]
[B]Lower your expectations a lot[E][C#m]
You might think your [A]dick is a gift I pr[B]omise it's not
[E]If you want love[C#m][A]
[B]Just pick a girl and lov[E]e her
Then whip out your [C#m]dick and let the
[A]Girl you love d[B]ecline the offer

[tab][ch]A[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]                         [ch]B[/ch]

I don't want a neat freak I don't want a slob[/tab]
[B]Or  somebody with bedhead and a dead-end jo[A]b
Cause I won't set[E]tle for less[B]
[B]Than perfect
[A]We want perfect c[E]hildren, a perfect li[B]fe
[B]Perfect husband or a perfect wi[A]fe
[A]But d[E]eep down we kn[B]ow
We don't [C#m]deserve it

[Mute]

But

[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]  [ch]C#m[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]

We all deserve love[/tab]
[B]Even on the days when w[E]e aren't our bes[C#m]t
Cause we all suc[A]k
But love can make us suck les[B]s
[E]We all d[C#m]eserve lo[A]ve
It's the v[B]ery best part of be[E]ing aliv[C#m]e
And [A]I would know
I'm [B]almost twenty f[E]ive
