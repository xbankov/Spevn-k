[E]A real girl, a hot girl, a really hot g[C#m]irl

And o[B]nly ever uses you to tickle her throat with

[E]Then you might t[A]hink that this girl o[E]nly exi[B]sts in your mind[C#m][A]
[E]She's real
But last [B]week

{start_of_chorus}
[E]If you want love[C#m][A]
[B]Lower your expectations a lot[E][C#m]
You might think your [A]dick is a gift I pr[B]omise it's not

[B]Just pick a girl and lov[E]e her
Then whip out your [C#m]dick and let the
[A]Girl you love d[B]ecline the offer
{end_of_chorus}

[A]I don't want a n[E]eat freak I don't want a sl[B]ob
[B]Or  somebody with bedhead and a dead-end jo[A]b
Cause I won't set[E]tle for less[B]
[B]Than perfect
[A]We want perfect c[E]hildren, a perfect li[B]fe
[B]Perfect husband or a perfect wi[A]fe
[A]But d[E]eep down we kn[B]ow
We don't [C#m]deserve it



We a[E]ll d[C#m]eserve l[A]ove
[B]Even on the days when w[E]e aren't our bes[C#m]t
Cause we all suc[A]k
But love can make us suck les[B]s
[E]We all d[C#m]eserve lo[A]ve
It's the v[B]ery best part of be[E]ing aliv[C#m]e
And [A]I would know
I'm [B]almost twenty f[E]ive
