[Intro]

[Dm] [F] [C] [Dm]

[Verse 1]

All my [Dm]life I’m on the run
On the [F]run to the sun
To burn [C]away my twisted s[Dm]oul

[tab]         [ch]Dm[/ch]

With the wings that He gave you[/tab]
We could [F]fly above the skies
I’m no [C]more afraid to d[Dm]ie

[Pre-chorus]

[Dm]Tell me everything you wanna [F]do
I’m with [C]you, only with y[Dm]ou
The [Dm]world is fine when somebody [F]loves you
That’s what [C]I do, only with y[Dm]ou

[Chorus]

I just wanna [G]seize the r[Am]ising s[Dm]un
I don’t wanna [G]spend all my l[Am]ife on the r[Dm]un
I wanna see your [G]shine from c[Am]rack of d[Dm]awn
All the way from [G]dawn, dawn t[Am]o dusk d[Dm]awn

[Verse 2]

Looking [Dm]back on a lonely life
Soon to be [F]left alone behind
I finally [C]found my harmon[Dm]y

[tab]              [ch]Dm[/ch]

Take all your books and dreams to me[/tab]
I love your [F]sins and melodies
We’ll start to [C]grow our family t[Dm]ree

[Pre-chorus]

[Dm]Tell me everything you wanna [F]do
I’m with [C]you, only with y[Dm]ou
The [Dm]world is fine when somebody [F]loves you
That’s what [C]I do, only with y[Dm]ou

[Chorus]

I just wanna [G]seize the r[Am]ising s[Dm]un
I don’t wanna [G]spend all my l[Am]ife on the r[Dm]un
I wanna see your [G]shine from c[Am]rack of d[Dm]awn
All the way from [G]dawn, dawn t[Am]o dusk d[Dm]awn

[Instrumental]

[Dm] [F] [C] [Dm]

[Bridge]

We quietly [Dm]face the days before
It’s up to [F]us to scream no more
Let’s [C]compose our symphon[Dm]y

[tab]          [ch]Dm[/ch]

Let those old dreams go, I said[/tab]
Rebuild my [F]life with me instead
I [C]fill the lines only with y[Dm]ou

[Pre-chorus]

[Dm]Tell me everything you wanna [F]do
I’m with [C]you, only with y[Dm]ou
The [Dm]world is fine when somebody [F]loves you
That’s what [C]I do, only with y[Dm]ou

[Chorus]

I just wanna [G]seize the r[Am]ising s[Dm]un
I don’t wanna [G]spend all my l[Am]ife on the r[Dm]un
I wanna see your [G]shine from c[Am]rack of d[Dm]awn
I don’t wanna [G]spend all my l[Am]ife on the r[Dm]un

[Final part]

[Dm]Run to the sun
Baby, [F]run to the sun
Baby, [C]run with me to the s[Dm]un

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]

Run to the sun[/tab]
Baby, [F]run to the sun
Baby, [C]run with me to the s[Dm]un

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]

Run to the sun[/tab]
Baby, [F]run to the sun
Baby, [C]run with me to the s[Dm]un

[tab][ch]Dm[/ch]

Run to the sun[/tab]
Baby, [F]run to the sun
Baby, [C]run with me to the s[G]un

[tab]       [ch]G[/ch]

To the sun[/tab]
To the [G]sun
My [C]only o[Dm]ne
