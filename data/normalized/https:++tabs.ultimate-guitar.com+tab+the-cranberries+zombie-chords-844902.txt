[Intro] 

[Em] [C] [G] [D/F#]  x4

[Verse 1]

[Em]Another h[C]ead hangs lowly, c[G]hild is slowly tak[D/F#]en
[Em]And the violence [C]caused such silence, w[G]ho are we mistake[D/F#]n 
But you [Em]see it's not me, it's not [C]my family
In your [G]head, in your head, they are figh[D/F#]ting 
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs and their [C]bombs and their guns 
in your h[G]ead, in your head, they are cry[D/F#]ing

[Chorus 1]

In your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie, [G]zombie, zombie [D/F#]
What's in your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie, [G]zombie, zombie [D/F#]

[Instrumental]

[Em] [C] [G] [D/F#] x2

[Verse 2]

[Em]Another mo[C]ther's breaking hear[G]t is taking over[D/F#]
[Em]When the violence [C]causes silence, w[G]e must be mist[D/F#]aken
It's the [Em]same old theme since [C]1916
In your [G]head, in your head, they're still fi[D/F#]ghting
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs and their [C]bombs and their guns
In your [G]head, in your head, they're dy[D/F#]ing

[Chorus 2]

In your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie, [G]zombie, zombie [D/F#]
What's in your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie, [G]zombie, zombie [D/F#]
