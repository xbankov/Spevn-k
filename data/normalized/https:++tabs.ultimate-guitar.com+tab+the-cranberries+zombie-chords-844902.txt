[Intro] 

[Em] [C] [G] [D/F#]  x4

[Verse 1]

[Em]Another head hangs l[C]owly, child is slowly taken[G][D/F#]
[Em]And the violence caused such[C] silence, who are we mistaken [G][D/F#]
But you [Em]see it's not me, it's not my family[C]
In your [G]head, in your head, they are fighting [D/F#]
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs and their bombs and t[C]heir guns 
in your h[G]ead, in your head, they are crying[D/F#]

[Chorus 1]

In your [Em]head, in your head, zombi[C]e, zombie, zombie [G][D/F#]
What's in your [Em]head, in your head, zombi[C]e, zombie, zombie [G][D/F#]

[Instrumental]

[Em] [C] [G] [D/F#] x2

[Verse 2]

[Em]Another mother's brea[C]king heart is taking over[G][D/F#]
[Em]When the violence causes sile[C]nce, we must be mistaken[G][D/F#]
It's the [Em]same old theme since 1916[C]
In your [G]head, in your head, they're still fighting[D/F#]
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs and their bombs and t[C]heir guns
In your [G]head, in your head, they're dying[D/F#]

[Chorus 2]

In your [Em]head, in your head, zombi[C]e, zombie, zombie [G][D/F#]
What's in your [Em]head, in your head, zombi[C]e, zombie, zombie [G][D/F#]
