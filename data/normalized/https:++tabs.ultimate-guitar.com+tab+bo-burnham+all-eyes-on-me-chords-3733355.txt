So I, I[G] quit,  [D]   and I didn't perform for five years, I [Em]spent that ti[C]me
trying[G] to improve myself mentally. [D]  And you know what?   [Em]   I did! [C]  I got better.
[G]  I got so much better[D], in fact, [Em]that in January [C]of
[G]2020, [D]      [Em]    I thought, "You know what? I[C] should
[G]   start performing [D]again. [Em]I've bee[C]n hiding from the world
