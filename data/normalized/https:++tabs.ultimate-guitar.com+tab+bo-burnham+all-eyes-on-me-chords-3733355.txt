{title: All eyes on me}

Hey Bo lovers! "INSIDE" is a masterpiece and I'm just a hack butttttt,

I wanted to play along, so I've done my best with my first tab :)

The whole song just builds on these four Chords: G D Em C

[Bridge 1]

[G]     You wanna hear a funny story?  [D]      [Em]    So[C], uh, five years ago,
I [G]quit performi[D]ng live [Em]comedy[C], because I was beginning to have uh,
[G]severe panic attacks, while on stage[D], which is not a great place[Em] to have them[C]
So I, I[G] quit,  [D]   and I didn't perform for five years, I [Em]spent that ti[C]me
trying[G] to improve myself mentally. [D]  And you know what?   [Em]   I did! [C]  I got better.
[G]  I got so much better[D], in fact, [Em]that in January [C]of
[G]2020, [D]      [Em]    I thought, "You know what? I[C] should
[G]   start performing [D]again. [Em]I've bee[C]n hiding from the world
[G]   and I need to.[D]..    [Em]     re-enter[C].
[G]   And then,[D] the funniest thing[Em] happened[C]

[Verse 1]

[C]    Are you feeling nervous?[G]
Are you having fun?[D]
It's almost over[Em], it's just begu[C]n
Don't overthink this[G], look in my eye
[D]Don't be scared, don't be shy
[Em]Come on in, the water's fine

[Verse 2]

[C]You say the ocean's r[G]ising
Like I give a [D]shit
You say the whole world's [Em]ending
Honey, it already [C]did
You're not gonna [G]slow it
Heaven knows you [D]tried
[Em]Got it? Good, now get ins[C]ide

[Pre-Chorus]

We're going to [G]go where everybody [D]knows
Everybody [Em]knows, everybody o[C]h
We're going to [G]go where everybody [D]knows
Everybody [Em]knows...
