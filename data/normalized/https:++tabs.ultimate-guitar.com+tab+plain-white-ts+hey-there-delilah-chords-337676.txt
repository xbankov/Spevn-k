[Verse 1]

[D]Hey there Delilah, what’s it l[F#m]ike in New York City? 
I’m a [D]thousand miles away, but girl ton[F#m]ight you look so pretty, 
Yes you [Bm]do, [G]Time Square can’t s[A]hine as bright as yo[Bm]u, 
I swear it’s [A]true.
[D]Hey there Delilah, don’t you w[F#m]orry about the distance, 
I’m right [D]there if you get lonely, give this s[F#m]ong another listen, 
Close your [Bm]eyes, [G]listen to my v[A]oice it’s my disgu[Bm]ise, 
I’m by your [A]side.

[Chorus]

[D]Oh it’s what you do to m[Bm]e, O[D]h it’s what you do to me[Bm], [A]
[D]Oh it’s what you do to m[Bm]e, O[D]h it’s what you do to me[Bm], 
What you do to [D]me.

[Verse 2]

[D]Hey there Delilah, I know t[F#m]imes are getting hard, 
But just be[D]lieve me girl some day, I'll pay the b[F#m]ills with this guitar, 
We'll have it [Bm]good, [G]we'll have the l[A]ife we knew we wo[Bm]uld, 
My word is [A]good.
[D]Hey there Delilah, I’ve got s[F#m]o much left to say, 
If every [D]simple song I wrote to you, would t[F#m]ake your breath away,
I’d write it [Bm]all, [G]even more in l[A]ove with me you’d fa[Bm]ll, 
We’d have it [A]all.

[Chorus]

[D]Oh it’s what you do to m[Bm]e, O[D]h it’s what you do to me[Bm], [A]
[D]Oh it’s what you do to m[Bm]e, O[D]h it’s what you do to me[Bm], [A]

[Bridge]

A [G]thousand miles seems pretty far, but t[A]hey’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
I’d [D]walk to you if I had no other w[Bm]ay 
Our [G]friends would all make fun of us, and w[A]e'll just laugh along because, 
We [D]know that none of them have felt this w[Bm]ay, 
De[G]lilah I can promise you, that b[A]y the time that we get through, 
The [Bm]world will never ever be the same, and you’re to [A]blame.

[Verse 3]

[D]Hey there Delilah you be g[F#m]ood, and don’t you miss me, 
Two more [D]years and you’ll be done with school, and I[F#m]'ll be making history, 
Like I [Bm]do, [G]you’ll know it's a[A]ll because of yo[Bm]u, 
[G]We can do whate[A]ver we want to[Bm], 
[G]Hey there Del[A]ilah here's to yo[Bm]u, this one’s for yo[A]u.

[Final Chorus]

[D]Oh it’s what you do to m[Bm]e, O[D]h it’s what you do to me[Bm], [A]
[D]Oh it’s what you do to m[Bm]e, O[D]h it’s what you do to me[Bm], 
What you do to [D]me.
Ohh[Bm]h[D][Bm][D][Bm][D][Bm][D][D]
