[Verse 1]

[D]Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New[F#m] York City? 
I’m a [D]thousand miles away, but girl tonight you l[F#m]ook so pretty, 
Yes you [Bm]do, Time Square[G] can’t shine as bright as you[A], [Bm]
I swear it’s [A]true.
[D]Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about[F#m] the distance, 
I’m right [D]there if you get lonely, give this song anothe[F#m]r listen, 
Close your [Bm]eyes, listen to m[G]y voice it’s my disguise[A], [Bm]
I’m by your [A]side.

[Chorus]

[D]Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s[Bm] what you do to[D] me, [Bm][A]
[D]Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s[Bm] what you do to[D] me, [Bm]
What you do to [D]me.

[Verse 2]

[D]Hey there Delilah, I know times are g[F#m]etting hard, 
But just be[D]lieve me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with [F#m]this guitar, 
We'll have it [Bm]good, we'll have [G]the life we knew we would,[A] [Bm]
My word is [A]good.
[D]Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much lef[F#m]t to say, 
If every [D]simple song I wrote to you, would take your b[F#m]reath away,
I’d write it [Bm]all, even more i[G]n love with me you’d fal[A]l, [Bm]
We’d have it [A]all.

[Chorus]

[D]Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s[Bm] what you do to[D] me, [Bm][A]
[D]Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s[Bm] what you do to[D] me, [Bm][A]

[Bridge]

A [G]thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got[A] planes and trains and cars, 
I’d [D]walk to you if I had no other way [Bm]
Our [G]friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just [A]laugh along because, 
We [D]know that none of them have felt this way, [Bm]
De[G]lilah I can promise you, that by the time[A] that we get through, 
The [Bm]world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.[A]

[Verse 3]

[D]Hey there Delilah you be good, and d[F#m]on’t you miss me, 
Two more [D]years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be mak[F#m]ing history, 
Like I [Bm]do, you’ll know[G] it's all because of you, [A][Bm]
[G]We can do whatever we wan[A]t to, [Bm]
[G]Hey there Delilah here'[A]s to you, this one’s for yo[Bm]u.[A]

[Final Chorus]

[D]Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s[Bm] what you do to[D] me, [Bm][A]
[D]Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s[Bm] what you do to[D] me, [Bm]
What you do to [D]me.
Ohh[Bm]h[D][Bm][D][Bm][D][Bm][D][D]
