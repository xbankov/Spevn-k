[Intro]

[ch]Bm[/ch]

[Verse]

[tab][ch]Bm[/ch]

I never believed that I would concede and let someone trample on me[/tab]
[G/B]You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but you were just gaslighting me
[Em/B]I’ve opened my eyes, & counted the lies, & now it is clearer to me
[Bm]You are just a user, and an abuser, living vicariously
[Bm]I never believed that I would concede and get myself blown asunder
[G/B]You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but now you have pushed me under
[Em/B]I’ve opened my eyes, and counted the lies,  now it is clearer to me
[Bm]You are just a user, and an abuser, and I refuse to take it

Now I’m coming back, a counterattack, I’m playing you at your own game[/tab]
[G/B]I’m cutting you out, a shadow of doubt Is gonna hang over your name
[Em/B]I’ve opened my eyes, I see your disguise I will never see you the same
[Bm]I know how to win, before you begin I’ll shoot you before you take aim
[Bm]Now I’m coming back, a counterattack a psychological war
[G/B]I’m cutting you in, I’m under your skin now I’m gonna settle the score
