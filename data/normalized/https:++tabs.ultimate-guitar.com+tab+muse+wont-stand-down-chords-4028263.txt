[Bm]I never believed that I would concede and let someone trample on me
[G/B]You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but you were just gaslighting me
[Em/B]I’ve opened my eyes, & counted the lies, & now it is clearer to me
[Bm]You are just a user, and an abuser, living vicariously
[Bm]I never believed that I would concede and get myself blown asunder
[G/B]You strung me along, I thought I was strong, but now you have pushed me under
[Em/B]I’ve opened my eyes, and counted the lies,  now it is clearer to me
[Bm]You are just a user, and an abuser, and I refuse to take it
