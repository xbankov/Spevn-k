{start_of_verse}
Whenever li[E]fe gets you do[G#]wn
Keeps you wea[A]ring a fr[Am]own
And the gr[B]avy tra[A#]in has le[A]ft you be[G#]hind[E]
And when your a[E]ll out of ho[G#]pe
Down at the e[A]nd of your ro[Am]pe
And nob[F#]ody's there to throw you a l[B]ine
If you e[A]ver get so low
That you don't k[Am]now which way to go
Come [E]on and take a walk in my sh[E7]oes
Never w[F#]orry 'bout a thing
G[F#]ot t[G#]he wo[A]rld on a string
Cause I've g[B]ot the cure for all of my blues (all of his blues)

I take a look at [E]my enormous [G#]peni[C#]s
And my tro[A]ubles start a-mel[B]tin' away[E] (ba-[E]doom [D#]bop)[E]
I take a look at [E]my enormous [G#]peni[C#]s
And the ha[F#]ppy times are comin' to s[B]tay (be-doo)
I got a s[A]ing and I dance
When I gl[Am]ance in my pants
And a-fe[E]elin's like a sun shiny da[D#]aaaa[C#]y
I take a look at [A]my enormous [B] Pee[E]--e--[D#]e--[D]nis[C#]
And a-ever[A]ything is go[B]in' my way[E] (ba-[E]doom [D#]bop)[E]
