Johnny B. Goode
Chuck Berry


[Verse]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
Who never ever learned to read or write so well,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
But he could play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell.[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go![/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Go, Johnny, go! Go!  [/tab]

Go, Johnny, go! 
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode[/tab]


[Verse]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Old engineers would see him sittin' in the shade,[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
When people passed him by they would stop and say,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
'oh, my but that little country boy could play'[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go![/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Go, Johnny, go! Go![/tab]

Go, Johnny, go! 
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode[/tab]


[Verse]

[tab]     [ch]A[/ch]
His mother told him, 'someday you will be a man,[/tab]
[tab][ch]A[/ch]
You will be the leader of a big ol' band.[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]D[/ch]
Many people comin' from miles around[/tab]
[tab]      [ch]A[/ch]
Will hear you play your music when the sun go down.[/tab]
[tab]    [ch]E[/ch]
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights,[/tab]
[tab]             [ch]A[/ch]
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight''[/tab]


[Chorus]

[tab]    [ch]A[/ch]
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go![/tab]
[tab]                 [ch]D[/ch]
Go, Johnny, go! Go![/tab]

Go, Johnny, go! 
[tab][ch]A[/ch]                   [ch]E[/ch]              [ch]A[/ch]
Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode[/tab]
