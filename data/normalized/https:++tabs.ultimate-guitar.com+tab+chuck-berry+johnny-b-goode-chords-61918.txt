Deep [A]down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,
[A]Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
There [D]stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where [A]lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who [E]never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could [A]play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

He us[A]ed to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
[A]Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
Old en[D]gineers would see him sittin' in the shade,
Strumm[A]in' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
When[E] people passed him by they would stop and say,
'oh, my but t[A]hat little country boy could play'

His m[A]other told him, 'someday you will be a man,
[A]You will be the leader of a big ol' band.
Many p[D]eople comin' from miles around
Will h[A]ear you play your music when the sun go down.
Mayb[E]e someday your name'll be in lights,
Sayin' 'Johnn[A]y B. Goode tonight''
