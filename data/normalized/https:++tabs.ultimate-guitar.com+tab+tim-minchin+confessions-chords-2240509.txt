I[F#7] believe that w[G]omen have the right to wa[A]lk the streets at ni[F#m7]ght
w[Bm7]ithout being afra[Em7]id for their l[D]ives
[F#7]I believe that [G]women have the right to choose what ha[A]ppens to her bod[F#m7]y
Without suff[Bm7]ering the ju[Em7]dgement of the conse[D]rvative right
And[F#7] I believe that [G]women have the right to we[A]ar the clothes they like
Wi[F#7]thout being treated like dir[Bm]t
A[Bm7]nd I think[G] we men are pathetic how we s[A]eem to judge aesthetic
As the me[F#m7]asure of a woman's w[B7]orth
{end_of_verse}

[G]I'm ashamed on behalf of my[F#m] se[Bm]x for making [Em]women[A] feel like ob[D]jects

{start_of_chorus}
Fuck I love boo[A9]bs though, I just really l[D]ove them
Fuck I love boo[A9]bs though, I just wanna ru[D]b them[D7]
They're just s[G]o jooby, they make me feel [Edim7]groovy
I would r[D]ather watch boobs than a mo[B7]vie
Be doop be [Em7]doo, I [A7]just really like b[D]oobs

{start_of_verse}
[F#7]I believe[G] people are entitled to [A]basic human r[F#m7]ights
[Bm7]Whether they are [Em7]rich or their [D]poor
[F#7]I believe a[G] world where no children are [A]starvi[F#m7]ng
[Bm7]Is a world worth[Em7] fightin[D]g for
[F#7]And I try to[G] remind myself, even when I'm [A]struggling
[F#7]How incredibly lucky I[Bm] am
[Bm7]And I don't think it's[G] ok that the luxuries I [A]crave
[F#m7]Should come at the expense of my fello[B7]w man
{end_of_verse}

[G]I'm sure I could give a l[F#m]ittle [Bm]more to a[Em]lleviate the s[A]uffering of the p[D]oor.

{start_of_chorus}
Fuck I love boo[A9]bs though, I just really l[D]ove them
I don't really [A9]mind if I am behind, below or abo[D]ve the[D7]m
They're just s[G]o jubbly, they make me feel[Edim7] lovely
I'd rathe[D]r own boobs than a p[B7]ub
Be doop be [Em7]doop doop doo doo[A7] doo, I really love[D] boobs.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[F#7]I believe the that[G] planet we live in is a [A]living o[F#m7]rganism
[Bm7]And we must[Em7] treat he[D]r carefully
[F#7]I don't think we can[G] assume we can just go on [A]consum[F#m7]ing
[F#7]Her resource[B7]s indefinitely.
{end_of_verse}

[G]The earth's not a bottomle[F#m]ss p[Bm]it, and we can [Em]all do our [A]little b[D]it.

{start_of_chorus}
Fuck I love boo[A9]bs though, I just really c[D]are for 'em
They're equally[A9] fun when they're aged 21,[D] or oc[D7]togenarian
They're just s[G]o flappy, they make me feel[Edim7] happy
I'd rathe[D]r eat boobs than a bap[B7]
Be doop be [Em7]doo, I [A7]just really love b[D]oobs.
Evolutionary[G6] theory says bosoms are but[A]tock-like protrusions
Des[F#m]igned to tempt men in sit[B7]uations when
They ca[G]n't get a glimpse of your bu[A]m
I [F#7]find such hypotheses [Bm]dumb, it's like the on[A]e that says
Li[G]pstick is for making yo[A]ur lips look more
Like the l[D]ips of a ha[A]ppy vagin[Bm]a[A]
Since they s[G]aid that I can't lo[Edim7]ok my great aunt in th[A]e eye
[F#7]Why'd they have to say that, oh wh[Bm]y?[A][G]
From that fi[G]rst little suck of colos[A]trum
[F#m7]To the grope of the the nurse in the old[B] people's hostel
We're ju[Em]st fuck[D]ing monk[G]eys in[G#dim]    s[A]hoes
And [D]Iei[Bm][G]
Will al[A]ways love boo[D]bs[Bm]
i Will a[G]lway[A]s love boobs[D]
