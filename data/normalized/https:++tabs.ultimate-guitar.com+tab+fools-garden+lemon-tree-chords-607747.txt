{start_of_verse}
I'm [Am]sitting here in a [Em]boring room,
It's [Am]just another rainy Sunday [Em]afternoon.
I'm [Am]wasting my time, I got [Em]nothing to do.
I'm [Am]hanging around, I'm [Em]waiting for you,
But [Dm]nothing ever [Em]happens - and I [Am]wonder.[Em][Am]

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Am]driving around - [Em]in my car,
I'm [Am]driving too fast, I'm [Em]driving too far.
I'd [Am]like to change my [Em]point of view
I [Am]feel so lonely, I'm [Em]waiting for you
But [Dm]nothing ever [Em]happens - and I [Am]wonder.[Em][Am]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I [C]wonder how, I w[G]onder why
[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the [Em]blue blue sky
And [F]all that I can s[G]ee is just a yellow le[C]mon tree.[G7]
I'm [C]turning my head - u[G]p and down,
I'm [Am]turning turning turning turning [Em]turning around
And [F]all that I can s[F#dim7]ee is just anoth[G]er lemon tree[G7].

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Am]sitting here, I [Em]miss the power.
I'd [Am]like to go out, tak[Em]ing a shower,
But [Am]there's a heavy cloud [Em]inside my head.
I [Am]feel so tired, put my[Em]self into bed,
Where [Dm]nothing ever [Em]happens - and I [Am]wonder.[Em][Am]
{end_of_verse}

[E]Isolation - I[Am]s not good for me,
[G]Isolation - I[C] don't want to si[E]t on a lemon tree.

{start_of_verse}
I'm [Am]stepping around in a [Em]desert of joy
[Am]Baby, anyhow I'll get [Em]another toy
And [Dm]everything will [Em]happen - and you [Am]wonder.[Em][Am]

And [F]all that I can s[G]ee, and al[F]l that I can see[G],
And [F]all that I can s[G]ee is just a yellow le[C]mon tree.
