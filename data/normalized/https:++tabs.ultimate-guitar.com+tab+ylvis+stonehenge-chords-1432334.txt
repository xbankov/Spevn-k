Tabbed by: AlfieC

This is one of my favourite songs, so I decided to upload what I think is the best way 

of playing it.
Took me a while to write it all out so please leave a comment and rate 5 stars.
Hope you enjoy! :D

[Verse]

My [Gm]life is so successful,
I've got everything a man could ever [Eb]need.
Got a [Gm]1000 dollar haircut,
And I even have a talkshow on [Eb]TV.
And I [Cm]know I should be happy, [Dm]but in[Eb]stead
There's a [Gm]question I can't get out of my [F]head.

[Chorus]

[C]What's the meaning of S[Gm]tonehenge?
It's [Eb]killing me that no one knows
Why [F]it was built 5000 years a[C]go.
[C]Why did they build the S[Gm]tonehenge?
How [Eb]could they raise the stones so high
Com[F]pletely without the technolog[Cm]y
We [Dm]have to[Eb]day?

[Verse]

When I [Gm]make my jalape√±os, calamari and prosciutto,
I'm the [Eb]king!
My wife ap[Gm]plauds me in the kitchen,
When I tell her all I bought is from[Eb] the local store
And when the [Cm]kids have gone to bed, we're [Dm]all a[Eb]lone
She gives me a [Gm]smile, then she plays with my [F]balls

[Chorus]

[C]But all I think of is S[Gm]tonehenge
I [Eb]think about it when I dream
The [F]biggest henge that I have ever s[C]een
[C]What's the purpose of S[Gm]tonehenge?
A [Eb]giant granite birthday cake
Or a [F]prison far too easy to es[G]cape?[Am]

[Bridge]

[F]  (Stonehenge! Stonehenge! Lots of stones in a row!)
They were [G]25 tons each stone, my friend
But a[Am]mazingly they got them all down in the sand
And they [F]moved it (Stonehenge!)
And they [F]dragged it (Stonehenge!)
And they [F]rolled it 46 miles from W[G]ales[D]!

[Chorus]

(What's the deal with [Am7]Stonehenge?)

Oh, what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal?

You [F]should have left a tiny hint
when you [G]made this fucking labyrinth of s[D]tone! (Who the...)
Who the fuck builds a [Am7]Stonehenge? (fuck builds a Stonehenge?)
Two [F]Stone Age guys wondering what to do
Who [G]just said: "Dude, let's build a henge or t[A]wo!"

[Outro]

I would give any[Em]thing to know (about the Ston[A]ehenge!)
Yeah, I would give all I [Em]have to give! (Would you give them your [A]car?)
Mmm, are you kidding me, of course I would have given the [Em]car!
(What car do you [A]drive?)
Drive a Civic, drive a Civic, [Em]drive a Civic! (A car you can [A]trust!)
Never mind the car, let's talk about the [Em]henge (What henge is that [A]again?)

It's the Stonehenge, it's the Stonehenge!

[Em]God, it is the greatest henge of [A]all!
What's the meaning of [Em]Stonehenge?
