1. This is the [Am]end you [Fmaj7]know
[C]Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
[G]We ain't nothing but f[D]ight and shout and te[Am]ars

We got to a point I can't [Fmaj7]stand
I've [C]had it to the limit; I can't be your man
[G]I ain't more than a m[D]inute away from wa[Am]lking



[F]  We can't c[C]ry the pain away[F]
We can't [C]find a n[G]eed to st[F]ay
I slowly [C]real[G]ized there's no[F]thing on our sid[G]e

{start_of_chorus}
{end_of_chorus}

[Am]Out of my life, Out of my [Fmaj7]mind
Out of the tears we can't de[G]ny
We need to [C/G]swallow all our[F] pride
And leave this mess behi[G]nd
[Am]Out of my head, Out of my [Fmaj7]bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're [G]bad
Tell them it's [C/G]me who made you[F] sad
Tell them the fairy[Am]tale gone bad

2. Another [Am]night and I [Fmaj7]bleed
They [C]all make mistakes and so did we
But [G]we did something we can n[D]ever turn back ri[Am]ght
Find a new one to [Fmaj7]fool
[C]Leave and don't look back. I won't follow
[G]We have nothing left. I[D]t's the end of ou[Am]r time



[F]  We can't c[C]ry the pa[G]in away[F]
We can't [C]find a n[G]eed to st[F]ay
There's no more [C]rabbits i[G]n my ha[F]t to make things rig[G]ht

{start_of_chorus}
{end_of_chorus}

[Am]Out of my life, Out of my [Fmaj7]mind
Out of the tears we can't d[G]eny
We need to [C/G]swallow all our[F] pride
And leave this mess behi[G]nd
[Am]Out of my head, Out of my [Fmaj7]bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're [G]bad
Tell them it's [C/G]me who made you[F] sad
Tell them the fairy[G]tale gone b[Am]ad

[Am]Out of my life, Out of my [Fmaj7]mind
Out of the tears we can't de[G]ny
We need to [C/G]swallow all our[F] pride
And leave this mess behi[G]nd
[Am]Out of my head, Out of my [Fmaj7]bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're [G]bad
Tell them it's [C/G]me who made you[F] sad
Tell them the fairy[G]tale gone b[Am]ad

[Am]Tell them the fairytale gone bad...
