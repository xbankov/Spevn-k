[Verse 1]

1. This is the end you know[/tab]
[C]Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
[G]We ain't nothing but fight and s[D]hout and tears[Am]

[tab]                          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]

We got to a point I can't stand[/tab]
I've [C]had it to the limit; I can't be your man
[G]I ain't more than a minute away[D] from walking[Am]

[Pre-Chorus]



[tab][ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]

  We can't cry the pain away[/tab]
We can't [C]find a need to sta[G]y[F]
I slowly [C]realized there[G]'s nothing on our side[F][G]

[Chorus]



[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]

Out of my life, Out of my mind[/tab]
Out of the tears we can't de[G]ny
We need to [C/G]swallow all our pride[F]
And leave this mess behi[G]nd
[Am]Out of my head, Out of my bed[Fmaj7]
Out of the dreams we had, they're [G]bad
Tell them it's [C/G]me who made you sad[F]
Tell them the fairy[Am]tale gone bad

[Verse 2]



[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]

2. Another night and I bleed[/tab]
They [C]all make mistakes and so did we
But [G]we did something we can never turn [D]back right[Am]
Find a new one to [Fmaj7]fool
[C]Leave and don't look back. I won't follow
[G]We have nothing left. It's the en[D]d of our time[Am]

[Pre-Chorus]



[tab][ch]F[/ch]          [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]     [ch]F[/ch]

  We can't cry the pain away[/tab]
We can't [C]find a need to sta[G]y[F]
There's no more [C]rabbits in my hat t[G]o make things rig[F]ht[G]

[Chorus]



[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]

Out of my life, Out of my mind[/tab]
Out of the tears we can't d[G]eny
We need to [C/G]swallow all our pride[F]
And leave this mess behi[G]nd
[Am]Out of my head, Out of my bed[Fmaj7]
Out of the dreams we had, they're [G]bad
Tell them it's [C/G]me who made you sad[F]
Tell them the fairy[G]tale gone bad[Am]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                        [ch]Fmaj7[/ch]

Out of my life, Out of my mind[/tab]
Out of the tears we can't de[G]ny
We need to [C/G]swallow all our pride[F]
And leave this mess behi[G]nd
[Am]Out of my head, Out of my bed[Fmaj7]
Out of the dreams we had, they're [G]bad
Tell them it's [C/G]me who made you sad[F]
Tell them the fairy[G]tale gone bad[Am]
