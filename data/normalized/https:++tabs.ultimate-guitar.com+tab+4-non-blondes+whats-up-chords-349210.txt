{start_of_verse}
[G]  Twenty-five years and my life is still
[Am]Trying to get up that great big hill
Of [C]hope for a destin[G]ation
I [G]realized quickly when I knew I should
That the [Am]world was made up of this brotherhood
Of [C]man, for whatever that m[G]eans
{end_of_verse}

And so I [G]cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to [Am]get it all out, what's in my head
and I [C]- I am feeling a little pec[G]uliar
And so I [G]wake in the morning and I step outside
and I [Am]take a deep breath and I get real high and
I [C]scream from the top of my lungs "What's going o[G]n?"

{start_of_chorus}
And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey H[Am]eyeyey"
I said "[C]Hey, what's going o[G]n?"
And I said "[G]Heyeyeyeyey H[Am]eyeyey"
I said "[C]Hey, what's going o[G]n?"
{end_of_chorus}

[G] Ooh, Oo[Am]h Oo[C]h[G]
[G] Ooh, Oo[Am]h Oo[C]h[G]

{start_of_verse}
And I [G]try, oh my God, do I t[Am]ry
I try all the [C]time, in this instit[G]ution
And I [G]pray, oh my God, do I p[Am]ray
I pray every single [C]day
For a revo[G]lution

And so I [G]cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
