Well, sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water[/tab]
And I [Cmaj7]think of all the things, what you're doin' and in my head I paint a picture[Dm7]

[Chorus]

'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess[/tab]
And I've [F]missed your ginger hair and the way you lik[Em]e to dress
[F] Won't you come on over, stop makin[Em]g a fool out of me[G]
[G7]Why don't you come on over, Va-a-lerie, Va[Cmaj7]lerie-e-ee[Dm7]
Va-[Cmaj7]a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee[Dm7]

Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer[/tab]
I hope you [Cmaj7]didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ya[Dm7]
Are you [Cmaj7]shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, are you busy[Dm7]?
And did you [Cmaj7]have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?[Dm7]

[Chorus]

[G7]Why don't you come on over, Va-a-lerie, Va[Cmaj7]lerie-e-ee[Dm7]
Va-[Cmaj7]a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee[Dm7]
