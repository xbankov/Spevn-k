Well, sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water[/tab]
And I [Cmaj7]think of all the things, what you're doin' and in my head I paint [Dm7]a picture

[Chorus]

[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                                [ch]Em[/ch]

'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess[/tab]
And I've [F]missed your ginger hair and the w[Em]ay you like to dress
[F] Won't you come on over, [Em]stop making a fool out of m[G]e
[G7]Why don't you come on over, Va-[Cmaj7]a-lerie, Va[Dm7]lerie-e-ee
Va-[Cmaj7]a-lerie, Va[Dm7]lerie-e-ee

Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer[/tab]
I hope you [Cmaj7]didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man who'll fix it [Dm7]for ya
Are you [Cmaj7]shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair[Dm7], are you busy?
And did you [Cmaj7]have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time, are you sti[Dm7]ll dizzy?

[Chorus]
