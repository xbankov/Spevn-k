{start_of_verse}
[E]Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his [A]daddy would visit he'd c[E]ome along
[E]When they'd gather 'round and started talking
[B7]That's when Billy would take me walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
The [E]only one who could ever reach me
[A]  Was the son of a pre[E]acher man
The [E]only boy who could ever teach me
[A]  Was the son of a pre[E]acher man
Yes he was, he w[B]as,  m[A]mm, yes he was
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[E]Being good isn't always easy
[A]No matter how h[E]ard I'd try
[E]When he started sweet-talkin' to me
[B7]He'd come and tell me everything is all right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
The [E]only one who could ever reach me
[A]  Was the son of a pre[E]acher man
The [E]only boy who could ever teach me
[A]  Was the son of a pre[E]acher man
Yes he was, he w[B]as,  m[A]mm, yes he was
{end_of_chorus}

(Yes, he w[D]as)

[A]  The look was in his eyes
[B7]   Takin' time to make time
[E7]   Learnin' from each other's knowin'

{start_of_chorus}
And the [A]only one who could ever reach me
[D]  Was the son of a pre[A]acher man
The [A]only boy who could ever teach me
[D]  Was the son of a pre[A]acher man
Yes he was, he w[E]as, o[D7]oh yes he was
{end_of_chorus}

(The o[A]nly one who could ever reach me
             [D]    Was the son of a pre[A]acher man)
