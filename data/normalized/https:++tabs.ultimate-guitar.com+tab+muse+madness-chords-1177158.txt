[A]I, I can't get these memories out of my mind 
And some kind of [D]madness has started to e[A]volve 
[A]I, I tried so hard to let you go 
But some kind of [D]madness is swallowing me w[A]hole, yeah 



[F#m]I have[E] finally [D]seen the light 
[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]realised what you m[A]ean 

{start_of_verse}

[A]And now I need to know is this real love 
Or is it just [D]madness keeping us a[A]float? 
[A]And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had 
It's like some kind of [D]madness was taking c[A]ontrol, yeah 



[F#m]And now I have[E] finally [D]seen the light  
[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]realised what you nee[A]d 



[A] [D] [A]

[F#m]And now I have[E] finally [D]seen the end 
[F#m]And I'm not[E] expecting [D]you to care, no 
[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]seen the light 
[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]realised 
I need to [F#m]love [E][D]
I need to [F#m]love [E][D]

{start_of_verse}
{end_of_verse}

[F#m]Come to me, just in a[E] dream 
Come on and [D]rescue me 
Yes I [F#m]know I can be[E] wrong 
Maybe I'm too [D]headstrong
