I, I can't get these memories out of my mind [/tab]

[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]realised what you m[A]ean

[tab][ch]A[/ch]

And now I need to know is this real love [/tab]
Or is it just [D]madness keeping us a[A]float? 
[A]And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had 
It's like some kind of [D]madness was taking c[A]ontrol, yeah

And now I have finally seen the end [/tab]
[F#m]And I'm not[E] expecting [D]you to care, no 
[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]seen the light 
[F#m]And I have[E] finally [D]realised 
I need to [F#m]love [E][D]
I need to [F#m]love [E][D]

Come to me, just in a dream [/tab]
Come on and [D]rescue me 
Yes I [F#m]know I can be[E] wrong 
Maybe I'm too [D]headstrong 

Our love is...
