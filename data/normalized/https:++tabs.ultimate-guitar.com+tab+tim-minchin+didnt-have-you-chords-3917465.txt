{title: Didnt have you}

[Intro]

[Cm]Yeah, y[Fm]eah...
[Dm]If I didn't [G7]have you

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]

[Verse 1]

If I di[Cm]dn't have you to h[Fm]old me ti[Dm7]ght
       [G7]
If I di[Cm]dn't have you to l[Fm]ie with at n[Dm7]ight
       [G7]
If I di[Cm]dn't have you to share m[Fm]y sighs
And to k[Dm]iss me and dry my te[G]ars when I cry

[Chorus]

Well [Ab]I
Really think that I w[Bb]ould

Have somebody else

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]

[tab]      [ch]Cm[/ch]

If I didn't have you[/tab]
[Fm]Someone else would [G]do[G7]

[Verse 2]

[Cm]Your love is o[Fm]ne in a mill[G]ion

[tab]              [ch]Cm[/ch]            [ch]Fm[/ch]

You couldn't buy it at any price[/tab]
 [Dm]         [G7]
But of the n[Cm]ine-point-nine-nine-nine-hundred-tho[Fm]usand other possible loves
S[Dm]tatistically, some of them would be e[G7]qually nice
Or m[Ab]aybe not as nice but, say, sm[Bb]arter than you
Or du[Ab]mber but better at sport or... fu[Bb]cking... tracing?

[Chorus]

I'm just sa[Ab]ying

I really think that I would

[Bb]Probably

Have somebody else

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]

If I di[Cm]dn't have you som[Fm]eone else would [G]do[G7]

[Verse 3]

[Cm]If I were a rich man[Fm]
Fiddle diddle diddle di[Dm]ddle diddle diddle diddle d[G7]ee
I g[Cm]uess I would be with a su[Fm]rgeon or a model
Or a re[Dm]llie of the royals or a Ken[G7]nedy
Or a n[Cm]ymphomaniacal exhibit[Fm]ionist heiress
[Dm]To a large chain of ho[G7]tels
[Cm]If I were a rich man, m[Fm]aybe I would fiddle
F[Dm]iddle diddle diddle with the r[G7]ich man gi[Cm]rls

[Bridge 1]

[Cm]I'm not saying that I'd not l[Fm]ove you
If [Dm]I was wealthy or hand[G7]some
But realistic[Cm]ally, there's lots of fish in t[Fm]he sea
And if I [Dm]had a different rod, I would conc[G7]eivably land some
[Cm]Even though I am fiscally consistently pit[Fm]iable
And considerably less 'Brad Pitt' than 'Brad pit[G]iful'

Am I really so poor and ugly that you think

Only you could possibly l[Ab]ove me?

[Chorus]

And I Really think that I would

[Bb]Probably

Have somebody else

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]

If I d[Cm]idn't have you som[Fm]eone else would [Dm]do[G7]

[Bridge 2]

Look, I'm [Cm]not undervaluing what we've g[Fm]ot when I say
That, given the r[Dm]ole chaos ine[G7]vitably plays
In the in[Cm]herently flawed no[Fm]tion of fate
It's abs[Dm]truse to deduce that I fo[G7]und my soulmate
At the age of [Cm]17
It's just mathem[Fm]atically unlikely that at a university in P[Dm]erth
I happened to stumble on the o[G7]ne girl on Earth
Specifically designed for [Cm]me
And if I may conjecture a further obj[Fm]ection
Love is nothing to do with destined perf[G]ection
The conne[G7]ction is strengthened
The affection simply grows over t[Ab]ime

[tab]        [ch]Ab[/ch]

Like a flower[/tab]
Or a mus[Bb]hroom

Or a guinea pig

Or a v[Ab]ine

Or a sponge

Or bigotry

[Bb]...or a banana
And l[Ab]ove is made more powerful
By the ongoing [Bb]drama of shared experience
And the sy[Ab]nergy of a kind of symbiotic em[Bb]pathy, or something

[Verse 4]

So I t[Cm]rust it would go without s[Fm]aying
That I would f[Dm]eel really very s[G7]ad
If tom[Cm]orrow you were to fall off some[Fm]thing high
Or c[Dm]atch something b[G7]ad
But I'm just sa[Ab]ying
I don't think you're spec[Bb]ial
I mean, I think you're spe[Ab]cial
But, you fall within a bell c[Bb]urve

[Chorus]

I mean, I'm just sa[Ab]ying I

Really think that I would

[Bb]Probably

Have somebody else

[Bridge 3]

[Cm]I think you are u[Fm]nique and b[G]eautiful
You make me h[Cm]appy just by b[Fm]eing ar[G]ound
But obje[Cm]ctively you would h[Fm]ave to agree
That b[Dm]aby when I fo[G]und you
Opt[Dm]ions were relatively th[G7]in on the ground
You're lo[Ab]vely but there must be girls as lo[Bb]vely as you
Or ma[Ab]ybe more open to span[Bb]king, or table ten[Ab]nis...

[Chorus]

I really think that I would

[Bb]Probably

Have somebody else

[Bridge 4]

[Cm]I mean I reckon it's pretty l[Fm]ikely that if for exa[G]mple
My first girlfr[G7]iend, Jackie, hadn't dumped me
[Cm]After I kissed Wi[Fm]nston's ex-girlfriend Ne[G]ah
At Steph's p[G7]arty back in 1993
[Cm]Enough variables would p[Fm]robably have been al[G]tered
By the abs[G7]ence of that event
[Cm]To have me[Fm]ant the ad[G]vent
Of a tangential narr[G7]ative in which we don't meet
Which is to [Cm]say there exists a the[Fm]oretical
Hypot[Dm]hetical paral[G]lel lif[G7]e
Where w[Cm]hat is is not as it [Fm]is
And I am not your hu[Dm]sband and you are not my w[G7]ife
And I am a st[Cm]untman living in [Fm]LA
Married to a s[Dm]mall blonde Portuguese s[G7]kier
Who when she's not tr[Cm]aining
Does abstract paint[Fm]ing
Pr[Dm]actises yoga
And b[G7]rews her own beer
And rea[Cm]lly likes making home mo[Fm]vies
And suf[Dm]fers neck down alo[G7]pecia

[Outro]

But with a[Ab]ll my heart and all my mind
I k[Bb]now one thing is true
I have j[Ab]ust one life and just one love
And my l[Bb]ove, that love is you
And if it w[Fm]asn't for y[Gm]ou
Darling, y[Ab]ou

I really think that I would

[Bb]Possibly

Have somebody else

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]G7[/ch]

If I di[Cm]dn't have you, d[Fm]o do do do
Someone e[Dm]lse would surely [G7]do
Ba doo ba [Cm]do ba ba d[G7]oo oh y[Cm]eah
