Intro: [Em] [G] [Am] [B5] [D]

I[Em]magine in your mind a posh [G]country club
The [Am]stuffy old money where the [B5]poor get [D]snubbed
T[Em]he spread is bland sauer[G]kraut and boiled goose
There's [Am]no way these people will [B5]ever cut [D]loose
But then I [Em]walk in the room, hold my [G]boombox high
And [Am]what happened next, will [B5]blow your [D]mind

[Em]Everything got outta con[Am]trol
The [D]music was so entr[G]ancing[D/F#]
[Em]Everyone got out on the [Am]floor
It was a [D]bunch of old white people d[G]ancing[D/F#]

The [Em]Big Apple, where [G]people never dance
[Am]Spirits go down while [B5]profits ex[D]pand
The [Em]cops or the dealers, who's [G]got the juice
The [Am]street vendors peddling their [B5]boiled [D]goose
So [Em]many types of people will [G]never get along
Till I [Am]bust out my boombox and [B5]play this [D]song

[Em]The music washed away all the [Am]hate
And so[D]ciety started ad[G]vancing[D/F#]
Every [Em]demographic was repre[Am]sented
It was a [D]rainbow coalition of d[G]ancing[D/F#]
[Em]Whoa[Am]
[D]Everyone was wearing f[G]ingerless glo[D/F#]ves
[Em]Whoah [Am]oh
I saw a [D]Spanish guy doing the B[G]artman[D/F#]

[Em]Transport now to an [G]old folks home
Where the [Am]elderly are tossed on their [B5]brittle [D]bones
The [Em]orderlies are stealing, there's [G]no excuse
[Am]Everyday for lunch they eat [B5]boiled [D]goose
So I [Em]grabbed my boombox and hit the [G]turbo base
And [Am]what happened next was a [B5]total dis[D]grace

[Em]Everybody started having [Am]sex
The [D]music was way too p[G]owerful[D/F#]
A bunch of [Em]old people fucking like [Am]rabbits
It was dis[D]gusting to say the l[G]east, oh[D/F#]
A [Em]boombox can change the [Am]world
You gotta [D]know your limits with a b[G]oombox[D/F#]
[Em]This was a cautionary [A]tale
A [D]boombox is not a t[G]oy[D/F#]
