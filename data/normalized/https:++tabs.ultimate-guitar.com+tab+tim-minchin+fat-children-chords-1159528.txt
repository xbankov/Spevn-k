Do not feed doughnuts to your obese children[/tab]
[Am]You will r[G]egret it when t[F]heyre in their tee[E7]ns
[Am]Maccas might [G]shut them up [F]now that theyre se[E7]ven
But th[F]ey wont forgive you, when
Theyre getting picked l[Dm]ast for PE[Am7]
[E7]Dont you see?

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]

Boombalata motherfucker[/tab]
[D9]Have you noticed that your ki[Dm]ds are fat?
[Am]What are you going to do about t[D7]hat?
[D7]What are you going to do?

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]D7[/ch]

So you telling me that your family[/tab]
[Am]Has a history of ob[D7]esity
You got a polyc[Am]ystic ova[D7]ry
[Am7]Its just the way that God made me[D7]

[tab][ch]E[/ch]                     [ch]Em7[/ch] 

Its unlikely, statistically[/tab]
To be a physi[D7]cal thing
But either wa[E7]y it dont explain why you[E7][B]
Are in the c[E7]ue at Burger King

[tab]          [ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]Am/D[/ch]

You can blame it on biology[/tab]
You can bl[G]ame your phy[G/D]siology
You can po[Am]int to genea[Am/D]logy
And your s[G]ocial anthro[G/D]pology
           
You can sa[Am]y you are an ectomorph
That you ju[Gaug]st cant get the kilos off
Well you can be[Bm] what you wanna be
But stop feeding that boy KFC[E7]

[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                         

He weighs 40 kilos and hes only three[/tab]
He lo[B7]oks like a clean-shaven Pavarott[E7]i

[tab][ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]

Ordering to Diet Coke is not the way back[/tab]
[G]Boombalata kiddie-stuffer
Your ki[D]ds a fat, have you notic[E7]ed that?

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]

And you oughta be ashamed[/tab]
For you only [Am7]have yourse[F]lf to blam[G]e.

[tab]                [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]

Your 5 year old princess in her size 14 tutu[/tab]
Only eats p[F]izza like that because yo[G]u do
She'lll be [F]dead of a heart attack
Befor[G]e your grandchildren are t[C]en[G][F][G]
Per[F]haps you’ll consider
A [G]cut-back on extra fries then[C][E7]

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]

Boombalata kiddie-stuffer[/tab]
[D9]Your kids are fat, have you n[Dm]oticed that
[Am]What are you going to do about that?
[D7]What are you going to do?

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]                              [ch]D7[/ch]

So you telling me that your family[/tab]
[Am]Has a history of ob[D7]esity
You got a polyc[Am]ystic ova[D7]ry
[Am7]Your mum had childhood diabe[D7]tes 

[tab][ch]Am7[/ch]           [ch]Am7[/ch]

But - and in your case[/tab]
There's a reasona[D7]bly big butt
Do you think[Am7] it's an appropriate treat
The all-you-can-eat at Piz[E7]za Hut?

[tab]            [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]Am/Ab[/ch]

There’s no excuse you silly goose[/tab]
For a [Am/G]child with [Am/Gb]a caboose
Like a [Am]moose who’s eaten too much mousse
It’s t[D]antamount to child a[D7]buse

[tab]           [ch]Am[/ch]               

Kick them off the fucking couch[/tab]
Un[G]plug the Playsta[G]tio[Em]n
Send them d[Am]own to the park
If they don’t w[G]anna go, make ’[G7]em

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]

Tell them they have to jog[/tab]
Until their [D7]jogging shorts fit’em
If they [D]hesitate, ask firmly
If they st[G]ill resist, hit’[Ab]em

[tab]     [ch]F[/ch]                          [ch]C[/ch]               

Is this what you want for your little girl and guy?[/tab]
These c[G]hips off the pork chop, for the t[D]offee apples of your eye?
[F]Six packs of kit cats are no[C]t the way back
[G]Boombalata Kiddie-Stuffer
Your k[D]ids are fat, did ya notic[E7]e that?

[tab][ch]Am[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]G[/ch]

And you ought to be ashamed[/tab]
For you have [Am]only have [F]yourself to bl[G]ame
Your 6 year old m[C]iniature Jabba the Hu[G]t
Eating half melted M[C]ars Bars from the folds of his g[G]ut
He'll be d[F]ead of an aneurysm
Bef[G]ore his own children ism ten[C][G][F][G]
Perha[F]ps you’ll consider
A c[G]ut-back on Taco Bell then[C][G][F][G]
Perha[F]ps you’ll consider
A c[G]ut-back on Krispy Kreme do[F]ughnuts
And Popcorn in [G]bucket-sized boxes
And m[F]icrowave pizza or d[G]rive through McDonalds
For we[F]eknightly dinners in fr[G]ont of the TV
And n[F]otes to the phys-ed i[G]nstructor saying timmy has 
[F]Asthma but he really just ge[G]ts short of breath
Cus he’s 3[F]5 kilos a[G]bove the ideal weight
Of 3[F]5 kilos for a nin[G]e year old bo[C]y
