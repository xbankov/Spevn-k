[Intro]

[Bb]I've been havi[A7]ng a little probl[Dm]em recently
Which[Gm/E] is quit[A7]e disturbing mus[Dm]icallically
In[Gm]volving a s[A7]emitonal discrepan[Dm]cy
V[Gm/E]ocally and instrume[A7]ntally
You see[Bb] musicians of [A7]different varieti[Dm]es
Prefer[Gm/E] playing i[A7]n particular ke[Dm]ys
And [Bb]singers too treat[Gm] preferentially[Dm/A]
Those [Gm]notes they tackle more[A7b9] proficiently

[Verse 1]

Now you don't [Bb]have to be a [A7]member of [Dm]MENSA
To u[Gm/E]nderstand the depth of[A7] my dilemma
The two[Bb] eleme[Bb/G]nts [Dm/A]of me [Gm/E]favou[A7]r two diff[Dm]erent keys
Thus a [Gm/E]rift betwixt[A7] my fingers and m[Dm]y tenor
[Bb]I like nothing more than playing [F]instruments in F
It w[Gm/E]arms the very cockles[A7] of my heart
The [Bb]trouble is that F can leave me [F]vocally bereft
You see I like [Gm/E]playing in F major
[A7]   But I like singing in F-

[Chorus]

[Dm]  Sharp
[Dm]F-Sharp
[Dm]F-Sharp

[Verse 2]

I re[Bb]fuse to be beholden to my [F]hands
I d[Gm/E]on't see why my larynx should [A7]give in to their demands
I'll [Bb]not be forced to compromise my [F]art
And[Gm/E] so I'll just keep playing in [A7]F major and singing in F-

[Chorus]

[Dm]Sharp
[Dm]F-Sharp
[Dm]F-Sharp

[Outro] 

I'll keep [Gm6]pla[Gm]yin[Gm6]g i[Gm]n F major
[C7sus4]    But I'll keep singing in F-
[F]Sharp
