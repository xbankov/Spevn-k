[Intro]

[G] [B] [C] [Cm]

[Verse 1]

When you were here be[G]fore, couldn't look you in the eyes[B]
You're just like an [C]angel, your skin makes me cry[Cm]

I wish I was [C]special, you're so fucking special[Cm]

But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a weirdo[B]
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't belong here[Cm]

[Verse 2]

I don't care if it [G]hurts, I wanna have control[B]
I want a perfect [C]body, I want a perfect soul[Cm]
I want you to [G]notice when I'm not around[B]
You're so fucking [C]special, I wish I was special[Cm]

[Chorus] (play loud)

[Cm](x3, very short)
But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a weirdo[B]
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't belong here[Cm]
