{start_of_verse}
When you were here be[G]fore, couldn't look you in the e[B]yes
You're just like an [C]angel, your skin makes me c[Cm]ry
You float like a [G]feather in a beautiful w[B]orld
I wish I was [C]special, you're so fucking s[Cm]pecial
{end_of_verse}

[Cm](x3, very short)
But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a w[B]eirdo
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't bel[Cm]ong here

{start_of_verse}
I don't care if it [G]hurts, I wanna have cont[B]rol
I want a perfect [C]body, I want a perfect s[Cm]oul
I want you to [G]notice when I'm not ar[B]ound
You're so fucking [C]special, I wish I was s[Cm]pecial
{end_of_verse}

[Cm](x3, very short)
But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a w[B]eirdo
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't bel[Cm]ong here

Oooh, oooh, [G]she's running out the d[B]oor...
[C]She's running out, she r[Cm]un, run, run...
[G]Ruuuuuu[B]uun...
[C]Ruuuuuu[Cm]uuuuun...

Whatever makes you [G]happy, whatever you w[B]ant
You're so fucking [C]special, I wish I was s[Cm]pecial

What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't bel[Cm]ong here
I don't be[G]long here
