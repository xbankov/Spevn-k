{title: Repeat stuff}

[Verse 1]

[D]I love your hair I love your name I love the way you say it
[Bm]I love your heart and your so smart 'cuz you gave away it
[G]I love your sis I love your dad I love your mom
[A]but more than all of the that I love the fact that you are dumb enough
[D]to not r[Bm]ealize everyt[G]hing I've said has been sa[A]id before
in a [D]thousand ways in a t[Bm]housand songs
[G]some with the same four c[A]hords (But you'll still love it and let me finger you!)

[Bridge]

[Bm]Oh girl, I hope you don't think that I'm r[G]ude
When I tell you that I love you [D]boo
I also hope you don't see t[A]hrough
This cleverly constructed [Bm]ruse
Designed by a marketing [G]team cashing in on puberty and low self e[D]steem
And girls' desperate need to feel [A]loved 

[Chorus]

[D]America says we love a c[Bm]horus, but don't get complicated and b[G]ore us
though meaning might be missing, we [A]need to know the words after just one listen
so re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff, rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff repeat stuff
   re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff, rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff, yeah!

[Verse 2]

[D]I love my baby and you know I couldn't live without her
[Bm]but now I need to make every girl think this song's about her
[G]just to make sure that they spread it like the plague so 
[A]I describe my dream girl as really really vague like
[D]I love your hands 'cause your fingerprints are like no other
[Bm]I love your eyes and their bluish brownish greenish color
[G]I love it when you smile, that you smile wide and I 
[A]love how your torso has an arm on either side. Now,

If you're my agent you might be thinking "Oh no, sound the alarms[/tab]
you're not a[Bm]ppealing to little [G]girls who don't have a[A]rms 
(But they can't use iTunes so f*** 'em who needs 'em!)

[Bridge]

[Bm]Oh girl, I hope you don't think that I'm r[G]ude
When I tell you that I love you [D]boo
I also hope you don't see t[A]hrough

Designed by a marketing [G]team cashing in on puberty and low self e[D]steem
And girls' desperate need to feel [A]loved

though meaning might be missing, we [A]need to know the words after just one listen
so re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff, rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff repeat stuff
   re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff, rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff, yeah!

[Interlude]

[D] [Bm] [G] [A]

[Verse 3]

I'm in [D]magaz[Bm]ines full of m[G]odel te[A]ens, so far abov[D]e you[Bm][G][A]
So [D]read them and h[Bm]ate yours[G]elf, and pa[A]y me to tell you I lov[D]e you      [Bm] (I [G]love you)[A]
[G]And your parents will a[A]lways come alo[D]ng,  '[Bm]cau[G]se their little girl[A]'s in love[D]
And [Em]how could love be [G]wro[A]ng?[D] How[Bm] could love be wro[G]ng?[A]   [D] Whe[Bm]n you
Re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff. Rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff repeat stuff

[Outro]

[D]We know it's not r[Bm]ight
[G]We know it's not fu[A]nny but we'll
[D]Stop beating this de[Bm]ad horse when it
[G]Stops spitting out m[A]oney
But until then
