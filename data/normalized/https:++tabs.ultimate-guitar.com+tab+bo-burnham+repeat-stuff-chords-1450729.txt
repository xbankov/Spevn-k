[D]I love your hair I love your name I love the way you say it
[Bm]I love your heart and your so smart 'cuz you gave away it
[G]I love your sis I love your dad I love your mom
[A]but more than all of the that I love the fact that you are dumb enough
[D]to not r[Bm]ealize everyt[G]hing I've said has been sa[A]id before
in a [D]thousand ways in a t[Bm]housand songs
[G]some with the same four c[A]hords (But you'll still love it and let me finger you!)
{end_of_verse}

[Bm]Oh girl, I hope you don't think that I'm r[G]ude
When I tell you that I love you [D]boo
I also hope you don't see t[A]hrough
This cleverly constructed [Bm]ruse
Designed by a marketing [G]team cashing in on puberty and low self e[D]steem
And girls' desperate need to feel [A]loved

[D]America says we love a c[Bm]horus, but don't get complicated and b[G]ore us
though meaning might be missing, we [A]need to know the words after just one listen
so re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff, rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff repeat stuff
   re[D]peat stuff, repeat s[Bm]tuff, repeat stuff, rep[G]eat stuff, repeat st[A]uff, yeah!

[D]I love my baby and you know I couldn't live without her
[Bm]but now I need to make every girl think this song's about her
[G]just to make sure that they spread it like the plague so 
[A]I describe my dream girl as really really vague like
[D]I love your hands 'cause your fingerprints are like no other
[Bm]I love your eyes and their bluish brownish greenish color
[G]I love it when you smile, that you smile wide and I 
[A]love how your torso has an arm on either side. Now,

[D]If you're my a[Bm]gent you might be t[G]hinking "Oh no[A], sound the alar[D]ms
you're not a[Bm]ppealing to little [G]girls who don't have a[A]rms 

[Bm]Oh girl, I hope you don't think that I'm r[G]ude
When I tell you that I love you [D]boo
