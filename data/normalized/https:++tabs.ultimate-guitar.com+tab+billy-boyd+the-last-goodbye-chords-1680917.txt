capo 5

[Verse 1]

[tab][ch]G[/ch]

        I saw the light fade from the sky[/tab]
On the wind[G] I heard a sigh
As the snow[Em]flakes cover [C]my fallen [Em]brothe[C]rs
I will sa[G]y this l[C]ast goodbye[G]

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

        Night is now falling[/tab]
[G]        So ends this day[D]
[Em]        The road is now [C]calling
[G]        And I must away[D]
[Em]Over hill and under tre[C]e
Through lands where n[Am]ever light has s[C]hone
By silver stream[G]s that run down[C] to the sea[Dsus4][D]

[Verse 2]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]

Under cloud, beneath the stars[/tab]
Over snow on[Am]e winter’s morn[C]
I turn at last[G] to paths t[C]hat lead home[Dadd4][D]
[Am]        And though where the r[C]oad then takes m[Em]e
I cannot tell[D]
[Am]     We came all this way[C]
But now comes the d[Em]ay to bid you fare[Dadd4]well[D]

[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]

Many places I have been[/tab]
Many sorrow[G]s I have [C]seen[G]
But I d[Em]on’t regr[C]et, nor will[Em] I forget[C]
All who took[G] that ro[C]ad with me[G]
 

[Chorus]

[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

        Night is now falling[/tab]
[G]        So ends this day[D]
[Em]        The road is now [C]calling
[G]        And I must away[D]
[Em]Over hill and under tre[C]e
Through lands where [Am]never light has shon[C]e
By silver stream[G]s that run down[C] to the sea[Dadd4][D]

[Verse 3]

[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

To these memories I will hold[/tab]
With your b[Am]lessing I will go[C]
To turn at [G]last to pa[C]ths that lead ho[Dadd4]me[D]
[Am]And though where the r[C]oad then takes [Em]me
I cannot tell[D]
[Am]We came all this way[C]
But now comes the d[Em]ay to bid you fare[Dadd4]well[D]
