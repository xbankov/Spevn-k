[Verse 1]



[tab][ch]G[/ch]

        I saw the light fade from the sky[/tab]
On the wind[G] I heard a sigh
As the snow[Em]flakes cover my fallen b[C]rothers[Em][C]
I will sa[G]y this last goodby[C]e[G]

[Chorus]



[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

        Night is now falling[/tab]
[G]        So ends this day[D]
[Em]        The road is now calling[C]
[G]        And I must away[D]
[Em]Over hill and under tree[C]
Through lands where n[Am]ever light has shone[C]
By silver stream[G]s that run down to the se[C]a[Dsus4][D]

[Verse 2]



[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                     [ch]C[/ch]

Under cloud, beneath the stars[/tab]
Over snow on[Am]e winter’s morn[C]
I turn at last[G] to paths that lead h[C]ome[Dadd4][D]
[Am]        And though where the road then ta[C]kes me[Em]
I cannot tell[D]
[Am]     We came all this way[C]
But now comes the d[Em]ay to bid you farewell[Dadd4][D]

[tab]           [ch]G[/ch]       [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]

Many places I have been[/tab]
Many sorrow[G]s I have seen[C][G]
But I d[Em]on’t regret, nor wil[C]l I forget[Em][C]
All who took[G] that road with me[C][G]
 

[Chorus]



[tab][ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

        Night is now falling[/tab]
[G]        So ends this day[D]
[Em]        The road is now calling[C]
[G]        And I must away[D]
[Em]Over hill and under tree[C]
Through lands where [Am]never light has shone[C]
By silver stream[G]s that run down to the se[C]a[Dadd4][D]

[Verse 3]



[tab]                [ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]

To these memories I will hold[/tab]
With your b[Am]lessing I will go[C]
To turn at [G]last to paths that l[C]ead home[Dadd4][D]
[Am]And though where the road then ta[C]kes me[Em]
I cannot tell[D]
[Am]We came all this way[C]
But now comes the d[Em]ay to bid you farewell[Dadd4][D]

[ch]C[/ch]  [ch]Em[/ch]  x3

I bid you a[C]ll a very fond farewell[G]
