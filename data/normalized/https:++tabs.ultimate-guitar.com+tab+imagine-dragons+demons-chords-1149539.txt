{title: Demons}

Capo 3rd fret

[Verse 1]

When the da[C]ys are cold
And the car[G]ds all fold
And the sai[Am]nts we see
Are all ma[F]de of gold
When your d[C]reams all fail
And the one[G]s we hail
Are the wor[Am]st of all
And the bl[F]ood's run stale

[Pre-chorus 1]

[C]  I wanna hide the t[G]ruth
I wanna shelter [Am]you
But with the beast [F]inside
There's nowhere we can [C]hide
No matter what we [G]breed
We still are made of [Am]greed
This is my kingdom [F]come
This is my kingdom [C]come

[Chorus]

[C]  When you feel my h[G]eat
Look into my [Am]eyes
It's where my demons [F]hide
It's where my demons [C]hide
Don't get too [G]close
It's dark in[Am]side
It's where my demons [F]hide
It's where my demons [C]hide

[Verse 2]

When the cu[C]rtain's call
Is the last[G] of all
When the li[Am]ghts fade out
All the si[F]nners crawl
So they du[C]g your grave
And the mas[G]querade
Will come c[Am]alling out
At the mes[F]s you made

[Pre-chorus 2]

[C]  Don't wanna let you d[G]own
But I am hell [Am]bound
Though this is all for [F]you
Don't wanna hide the [C]truth
No matter what we [G]breed
We still are made of [Am]greed
This is my kingdom [F]come
This is my kingdom [C]come

[Chorus]

[C]  When you feel my h[G]eat
Look into my [Am]eyes
It's where my demons [F]hide
It's where my demons [C]hide
Don't get too [G]close
It's dark in[Am]side
It's where my demons [F]hide
It's where my demons [C]hide

[Bridge]

[C]  They say it's what you m[G]ake
I say it's up to [Am]fate
It's woven in my [F]soul
I need to let you [C]go
Your eyes, they shine so [G]bright
I wanna save that [Am]light
                     N.C.
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me [C]how

[Chorus]

[C]  When you feel my h[G]eat
Look into my [Am]eyes
It's where my demons [F]hide
It's where my demons [C]hide
Don't get too [G]close
It's dark in[Am]side
It's where my demons [F]hide
It's where my demons [C]hide
