[F]I really like Christmas
It’s sentim[Bb]ental I know, but I just really l[F]ike it
[F]I’m, I’m hardly religious
I’d rather break br[Bb]ead with Dawkins than Desmond Tutu to be h[F]onest
And yes I have [C]all of the usual objections to consu[C7]merism
To the commercialisation of an ancient [Bb]religion
{end_of_verse}

Press-ganged into selling PlayStations and be[F]er
But I still really like it.[C]

[F]I’m looking forward to Christmas
Though I’m not [Bb]expecting a visit from J[F]esus
I’ll be seeing my d[C]ad
My br[C7]other and sisters, my [A7]gran and my m[Dm]um
They’ll be [Dm/C]drinking white wine in the[Bb] sun
I’ll be seeing my d[C]ad
My b[C7]rother and sisters, my [A7]gran and my [Dm]mum
They’ll b[Dm/C]e drinking white wine in t[Bb]he sun.

{start_of_verse}
[F]I don’t go in for ancient wisdom
I don’t bel[Bb]ieve just ’cause ideas are tenacious it means that they’re w[F]orthy
[F]I get freaked out by churches
Some of the h[Bb]ymns that they sing have nice chords but the lyrics are d[F]odgy
And yes I have [C]all of the usual objections 
To the mis-educ[C7]ation of children who in tax-exempt institu[Bb]tions
{end_of_verse}



And to judge things as plain right or wr[F]ong
But I quite like the s[C]ongs.

[F]I’m not expecting big presents
The old combi[Bb]nation of socks, jocks and chocolates is just fine by[F] me.
‘Cause I’ll be seeing my d[C]ad
My b[C7]rother and sisters, my [A7]gran and my [Dm]mum
They’ll be [Dm/C]drinking white wine in the sun[Bb]
I’ll be seeing my d[C]ad
My [C7]brother and sisters, my [A7]gran and my [Dm]mum
They’ll be [Dm/C]drinking white wine in the su[Bb]n.

{start_of_chorus}
And [Bb]you my baby girl
My j[F/A]etlagged infant daughter
You’ll be h[Gm7]anded round the room
Like a p[C]uppy at a p[Csus4]rimar[C]y school
And [Bb]you won't understand
But y[F/A]ou will learn some day
That w[Gm7]herever you are and whatever you face
[C]These are the people who’ll m[C7]ake you feel saf[A7]e in this wor[Dm]ld
[Dm/C]  My sweet blue-eye[Bb]d girl
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
And [Bb]if my baby girl
When you’re [F/A]twenty-one or thirty-one
And [Gm7]Christmas comes around
And you f[C]ind yourself nine thousand m[Csus4]iles fro[C]m home
[Bb]You’ll [F/A]know[Gm7] what-ever--[C]-- comes
Your br[C7]others and sisters, an[A7]d me and your[Dm] mum
Will be [Dm/C]waiting for you in the su[Bb]n
whenever you com[C]e[Csus4][C]
[C7]Your brothers and sisters, your aunts and your uncles
Your gr[C7]andparents, cousins, and [A7]me and your m[Dm]um
We’ll be [Dm/C]waiting for you in the [Bb]sun
[F/A]drinking white wine in[Gm7] the sun
[C]Darling, when xmas c[Bb]omes
[F/A]We’ll be waiting for you in the[Gm7] sun
[F/A]drinking white wine in the s[Bb]un
[F/A]waiting for you in the[Gm7] sun
[C]waiting for you [Bb]
