[C]  So lately,[G] been wondering w[Am]ho will be th[F]ere to take my place[C]
When I'm gone[G] you'll need love [Am]to light the s[F]hadows on your fac[C]e
If a gr[G]eat wave shall fa[Am]ll and fa[F]ll upon us all[C]
Then betw[G]een sand and sto[Am]ne could you ma[F]ke it on your own?

[C]  If I could [G]then I would, [Am]I'll go wherev[F]er you will go[C]
Way up high[G] or down low,[Am] I'll go where[F]ver you will go[C]

A[C]nd maybe [G]I'll find out a[Am] way to ma[F]ke it back someday[C]
To watch you[G], to guide you [Am]through the d[F]arkest of your day[C]s
If a gr[G]eat wave shall fa[Am]ll and fa[F]ll upon us all[C]
Well, then I [G]hope there's someone o[Am]ut there who can b[F]ring me back to you
