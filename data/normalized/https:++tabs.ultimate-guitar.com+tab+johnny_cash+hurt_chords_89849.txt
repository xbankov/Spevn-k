Note: to play the chorus correctly and simulate the piano playing, keep the G on the third fret of the

high e string fretted with your pinky. This makes the chords G major, Am7, Fadd9, and C major.
I also suggest playing a Hendrix Fadd9, so wrap your thumb and play 1st fret low E string.

The strum pattern for Intro/Verse/Transition is picked for the downs and strummed for the ups.

I suggest picking the A and D strings, and then up strum.
