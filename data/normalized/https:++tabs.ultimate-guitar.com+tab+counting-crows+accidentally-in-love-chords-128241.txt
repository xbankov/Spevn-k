[G]   [C]   [Em]  [A]   [C]  (hold)

[Verse 1]

[G]  So she said what's the p[C]roblem baby
[G]   What's the problem I don't k[C]now
Well maybe I'm in[Em] love (love)
Think about it [A]everytime I think about it
[C]Can't stop thinking 'bout it

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                         [ch]C[/ch]

  How much longer will it take to cure this?[/tab]
[G]  Just to cure it 'cause I c[C]an't ignore it if it's lo[Em]ve (love)
Makes me wanna [A]turn around and face me but I d[D]on't know
Nothing 'bout [C]love            Ahhhh

[Chorus]

[G]Come on, [Am]come on
[C]Turn a little f[D]aster
[G]Come on, c[Am]ome on
The [C]world will follow a[D]fter
[G]Come on, c[Am]ome on
[C]'Cause everybody's [D]after l[Em]ove[A][C]

[Verse 2]

[G]  So I said I'm a s[C]nowball running
[G]  Running down into the sp[C]ring that's coming all this lo[Em]ve
Melting under [A]blue skies belting out s[C]unlight
shimmering [G]love
Well baby [C]I surrender to the s[G]trawberry ice cream
[C]never ever end of all this [Em]love
Well I [A]didn't mean to do it
But there's[D] no escaping your [C]love   ahhhhh

[Bridge]

[Em]  These line of [C]lightning mean we're
[G]never alone, n[Am]ever alone
N.C.
no no

[Chorus]

[G]Come on, c[Am]ome on
[C]Move a little c[D]loser
[G]Come on, c[Am]ome on
I wa[C]nt to hear you w[D]hisper
[G]Come on, c[Am]ome on
[C]Settle down insi[D]de my lo[Em]ve  [D]          Ahhhh

[tab][ch]G[/ch]        [ch]Am[/ch]

[C]Jump a little h[D]igher
[G]Come on, c[Am]ome on

We [C]were once upon a t[D]ime in lo[Em]ve[A][C]
