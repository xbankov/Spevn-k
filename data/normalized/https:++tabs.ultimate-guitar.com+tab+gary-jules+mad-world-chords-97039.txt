[Intro]

[Em]   [A]
[Em]   [A]

[Verse 1]

[Em]   All around me are familiar face[G]s
[D]Worn out places, worn out fa[A]ces
[Em]   Bright and early for their daily races[G]
[D]Going nowhere, going nowhe[A]re
[Em]   Their tears are filling up their gl[G]asses
[D]No expression, no expressi[A]on
[Em]   Hide my head, I want to drown my so[G]rrow
[D]No tomorrow, no tomorrow[A]

[Chorus]

[Em]   And I find it kinda funny, I fi[A]nd it kinda sad[Em]
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever had[Em]
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to take[Em]
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very
[Em]   Mad world[A]
[Em]   Mad world[A]

[Verse 2]

[Em]   Children waiting for the day they fe[G]el good
[D]Happy birthday, happy birth[A]day
[Em]   And I feel the way that every child[G] should
[D]Sit and listen, sit and lis[A]ten
[Em]   Went to school, and I was very nervou[G]s
[D]No one knew me, no one knew[A] me
[Em]   Hello, teacher, tell me what's my l[G]esson
[D]Look right through me, look right [A]through me

[Chorus]

[Em]   And I find it kinda funny, I fi[A]nd it kinda sad[Em]
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever had[Em]
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to take[Em]
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very
[Em]   Mad world[A]
[Em]   Mad world[A]
[Em]   Enlarging your world[A]
[Em]   Mad world[A]
