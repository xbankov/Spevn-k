[Em]   [A]
[Em]   [A]

[Verse 1]

[Em]   All around me are fa[G]miliar faces
[D]Worn out places, w[A]orn out faces
[Em]   Bright and early for their [G]daily races
[D]Going nowhere, g[A]oing nowhere
[Em]   Their tears are filling [G]up their glasses
[D]No expression, n[A]o expression
[Em]   Hide my head, I want to [G]drown my sorrow
[D]No tomorrow, n[A]o tomorrow

[Chorus]

[Em]   And I find it kinda [A]funny, I find it kinda s[Em]ad
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever h[Em]ad
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to t[Em]ake
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very
[Em]   Mad w[A]orld
[Em]   Mad w[A]orld

[Verse 2]

[Em]   Children waiting for the [G]day they feel good
[D]Happy birthday, h[A]appy birthday
[Em]   And I feel the way that [G]every child should
[D]Sit and listen, s[A]it and listen
[Em]   Went to school, and I was [G]very nervous
[D]No one knew me, n[A]o one knew me
[Em]   Hello, teacher, tell me [G]what's my lesson
[D]Look right through me, l[A]ook right through me

[Chorus]

[Em]   And I find it kinda [A]funny, I find it kinda s[Em]ad
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever h[Em]ad
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to t[Em]ake
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very
[Em]   Mad w[A]orld
[Em]   Mad w[A]orld
[Em]   Enlarging you[A]r world
[Em]   Mad w[A]orld
