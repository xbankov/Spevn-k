{title: The sound of silence}

{start_of_verse}
[Am]   Hello darkness, my old [G]friend,
I've come to talk with you [Am]again,
Because a vision soft[F]ly creepi[C]ng,
Left its seeds while I [F]was sleep[C]ing,
And the [F]vision that was planted in my b[C]rain
Still remain[C/B]s[Am]
[C]Within the so[G]und of sil[Am]ence.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In restless dreams I walked a[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobble[Am]stone,
'neath the halo of [F]a street l[C]amp,
I turned my collar to the [F]cold and d[C]amp
When my [F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon l[C]ight
That split the night[C/B][Am]
A[C]nd touched the s[G]ound of si[Am]lence.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And in the naked light I [G]saw
Ten thousand people, maybe [Am]more.
People talking with[F]out speak[C]ing,
People hearing with[F]out listen[C]ing,
People writing [F]songs that voices never s[C]hare
And no one dar[C/B]e[Am]
[C]Disturb the s[G]ound of si[Am]lence.

{start_of_verse}
Fools said I, you do not [G]know
Silence like a cancer [Am]grows.
Hear my words that I [F]might teach y[C]ou,
Take my arms that I [F]might reach y[C]ou.
But my [F]words like silent raindrops f[C]ell,[C/B][Am]
And[C] echoed
In the [G]wells of s[Am]ilence
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And the people bowed and [G]prayed
To the neon God they [Am]made.
And the sign flashed out [F]its warn[C]ing,
In the words that it w[F]as form[C]ing.
And the sign said, the [F]words of the prophets
Are written on the subway w[C]alls
And tenement [C]halls.[C/B][Am]
And whisp[C]er'd in the s[G]ounds of si[Am]lence.
