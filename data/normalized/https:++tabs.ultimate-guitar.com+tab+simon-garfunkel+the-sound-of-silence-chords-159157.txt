{title: The sound of silence}

[Verse 1]

[Am]   Hello darkness, my old friend,[G]
I've come to talk with you [Am]again,
Because a vision soft[F]ly creeping,[C]
Left its seeds while I [F]was sleeping,[C]
And the [F]vision that was planted in my brain[C]
Still remain[C/B]s[Am]
[C]Within the sound of sil[G]ence.[Am]

[Verse 2]

In restless dreams I walked a[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobble[Am]stone,
'neath the halo of [F]a street lamp,[C]
I turned my collar to the [F]cold and damp[C]
When my [F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light[C]
That split the night[C/B][Am]
A[C]nd touched the sound of si[G]lence.[Am]

[Verse 3]

And in the naked light I [G]saw
Ten thousand people, maybe [Am]more.
People talking with[F]out speaking,[C]
People hearing with[F]out listening,[C]
People writing [F]songs that voices never share[C]
And no one dar[C/B]e[Am]
[C]Disturb the sound of si[G]lence.[Am]

[Verse 4]

Fools said I, you do not [G]know
Silence like a cancer [Am]grows.
Hear my words that I [F]might teach you,[C]
Take my arms that I [F]might reach you.[C]
But my [F]words like silent raindrops fell,[C][C/B][Am]
And[C] echoed
In the [G]wells of silence[Am]

[Verse 5]

And the people bowed and [G]prayed
To the neon God they [Am]made.
And the sign flashed out [F]its warning,[C]
In the words that it w[F]as forming.[C]
And the sign said, the [F]words of the prophets
Are written on the subway w[C]alls
And tenement [C]halls.[C/B][Am]
And whisp[C]er'd in the sounds of s[G]ilence.[Am]
