{title: Cant stop}

[Verse 1]

[Em]Can't stop, addicted to the shindig 
[D]Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big 
[Bm]Choose not a life of imitation 
[C]Distant cousin to the reservation 
[Em]Defunct, the pistol that you pay for 
[D]This punk, the feeling that you stay for 
[Bm]In time I want to be your best friend 
[C]Eastside love is living on the westend 
[Em]Knocked out, but boy you better come to 
[D]Don't die, you know the truth as some do 
[Bm]Go write your message on the pavement 
[C]Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant 
[Em]White heat is screaming in the jungle 
[D]Complete the motion if you stumble 
[Bm]Go ask the dust for any answers 
[C]Come back strong with 50 belly dancers 

[Chorus]

The w[G]orld I love
The t[D]ears I've dropped
To [Bm]be part of
the w[C]ave can't stop
[G]Ever wonder if it's all[D] for you[Bm][C]
The w[G]orld I love
The tr[D]ains I hop
To [Bm]be part of
The w[C]ave can't stop
C[G]ome and tell me when it's tim[D]e to[Bm][C]

[Verse 2]

[Em]Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone 
[D]So smart, she's leading me to ozone 
[Bm]Music, the great communicator 
[C]Use two sticks to make it in the nature 
[Em]I'll get you into penetration 
[D]The gender of a generation 
[Bm]The birth of every other nation 
[C]Worth your weight, the gold of meditation 
[Em]This chapter's going to be a close one 
[D]Smoke rings, I know you're going to blow one 
[Bm]All on a spaceship, persevering 
[C]Use my hands for everything but steering 
[Em]Can't stop the spirits when they need you 
[D]Mop tops are happy when they feed you 
[Bm]Jay butterfly is in the treetop 
[C]Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

[Chorus]

The w[G]orld I love
The t[D]ears I've dropped
To [Bm]be part of
the w[C]ave can't stop
[G]Ever wonder if it's all[D] for you[Bm][C]
The w[G]orld I love
The tr[D]ains I hop
To [Bm]be part of
The w[C]ave can't stop
C[G]ome and tell me when it's tim[D]e to[Bm][C]

[Interlude]

[Em]Wait a minute, I'm passing out,[D] win or lose, just like you [Bm][C]
[Em]Far more shockin' than anything I ev[D]er knew, how 'bout you [Bm][C]
[Em]Ten more reasons why I need s[D]omebody new, just like you [Bm][C]
[Em]Far more shockin' than anything I ev[D]er knew, right on cue [Bm][C]

[Verse 3]

[Em]Can't stop, addicted to the shindig 
[D]Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big 
[Bm]Choose not a life of imitation 
[C]Distant cousin to the reservation 
[Em]Defunct, the pistol that you pay for 
[D]This punk, the feeling that you stay for 
[Bm]In time I want to be your best friend 
[C]Eastside love is living on the westend 
[Em]Knocked out, but boy you better come to 
D[D]on't die, you know the truth as some do 
[Bm]Go write your message on the pavement 
[C]Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant 
[Em]Kick start the golden generator 
[D]Sweet talk but don't intimidate her 
[Bm]Can't stop the Gods from engineering 
[C]Feel no need for any interfering 
[Em]Your image in the dictionary 
[D]This life is more than ordinary 
[Bm]Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
[C]Comin' from space to teach you of the Pleiades 
N.C.
Can't stop the spirits when they need you 
N.C.
This life is more than just a read-thru
