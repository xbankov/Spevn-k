Your be[Am]auty is be[C]yond compare
With fl[G]aming locks of aub[Am]urn hair
With iv[G]ory skin and ey[Em]es of emerald gr[Am]een
Your sm[Am]ile is like a b[C]reath of spring
Your vo[G]ice is soft like sum[Am]mer rain
And I c[G]annot compe[Em]te with you, Jo[Am]lene

He t[Am]alks about you [C]in his sleep
There[G]'s nothing I can d[Am]o to keep
From cr[G]ying when he ca[Em]lls your name, Jo[Am]lene
And [Am]I can easily u[C]nderstand
How [G]you could easily ta[Am]ke my man
But you d[G]on't know what he me[Em]ans to me, Jo[Am]lene

[Am]You could have your ch[C]oice of men

And what[G]ever you dec[Em]ide to do, Jol[Am]ene
