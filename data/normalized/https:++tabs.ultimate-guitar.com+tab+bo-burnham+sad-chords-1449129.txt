[Intro]

It's about all the sad stuff I see in the world
I see a lot of sad stuff and it's called sad

I met a homeless man named Rich[/tab]
[C]Isn't that t[G]errible?
I saw a f[C]lyer for a lost d[F]og
And the [Am]dog didn't have any le[Em]gs
I saw a d[C]iabetic ki[F]d tric[Am]k-or-tr[G]eating
I sa[C]w a giraffe who [F]had a short neck
[Am]That was sad,[G] or a deer

I saw an old man get hit by a train[/tab]
He didn't [E]see it in the pouring ra[F]in                                          
He didn't h[C]ear me shout, "Look out for the tr[G]ain!"[E]

Because I didn't say anything.

[C]I just [F]thought to[C/G] myself, "O[Em]oh, this is gonna be sad."
[C]       [F]    An[C/G]d it w[Em]as.
[C]      I[F]'m a g[C/G]enius.[Em]

I saw a man with only one eye[/tab]
[C]In a 3D m[G]ovie
I saw a [C]little boy drop his ice cre[F]am cone
[Am]Directly on his mother's corp[Em]se
I saw a [C]kitten stuck in a tr[F]ee
Then the [Am]kitten jumped off and he [G]hung himself
I saw a bo[C]y who had red [F]hair.[Am][G]

I went to a store looking for something to buy[/tab]
But they only sold pa[E]intings of the same sad gu[F]y
No, [C]wait--this store sells m[G]irrors! 
See what I [E]did there?
Let's rock! No.[C][Em][F][Fm]

[Spoken]

   
[C]The worl[Em]d's so[F] sad, Ma[Fm]ddison. 
[C]Pain, wa[Em]r, geno[F]cide, rac[Fm]ism, sexism. 
[C]But I've g[Em]otta remem[F]ber there's[Fm] good things about it too. 
[C]Like the f[Em]act that [F]none of tha[Fm]t's happening to me! Score! 
[C]Still, tho[Em]ugh, it'[F]s hard not[Fm] to be sad about it. 
[C]How do[Em] y'al[F]l do [Fm]it? 
I've been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song; you 
[C]haven'[Em]t been [F]sad at all[Fm]. 
[C]You've be[Em]en happy--no,[F] you've been la[Fm]ughing.
[C]That's it, l[Em]aughter, it[F]'s the key to e[Fm]verything. 
[C]It's the[Em] way to so[F]lve all the sadnes[Fm]s in the world!
[C]I mean n[Em]ot for the[F] people that are a[Fm]ctually sad,
[C]but the [Em]people lik[F]e us that've gotta[Fm] fucking deal with them all the time.
[C]Being a co[Em]median isn't [F]being an insensi[Fm]tive prick 
[C]capitalizin[Em]g on the most[F] animalistic im[Fm]pulses of the public;
[C]it's being a hero! T[Em]he world isn't sad. The worl[F]d's funny! 
I'm [G]a sociopath!

I saw an old man slip and fall[/tab]
[Am]Hey, what a fucking [G]idiot
I saw a [C]woman at her daughter's f[F]uneral
[Am]Ha ha ha. [G]Classic comedy.
[C]Everything that once was s[F]ad
[Am]Is somehow [G]funny now
The H[C]olocaust and 9[F]/11
[Am]That shit's funny [G]24/7, cuz
[E]Tragedy will be excl[F]usively jok[C]ed about[G]
Because my e[E]mpathy is bumming me o[F]ut[C]
Goodbye, s[G]adness[E]
Hello joke[C]s.[F][C/G][Em][C]
