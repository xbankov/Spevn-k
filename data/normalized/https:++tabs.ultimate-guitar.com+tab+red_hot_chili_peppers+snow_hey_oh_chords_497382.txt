    [Em]Come to decide that the [C]things that I tried
    Were [G]in my life just t[D]o get high on.
[Em]    When I sit alone, [C]come, get a little known,
    [G]But I need more than mys[D]elf this time.
    [Em]Step from the road to the [C]sea to the sky,
    And I [G]do believe that w[D]e rely on.
[Em]    When I lay it on,[C] come, get to play it on, a[G]ll my life to sacr[D]ifice.

    [Em]When will I know that I [C]really can’t go
    To the [G]well once more, time t[D]o decide on.
[Em]    When it’s killing me, [C]when will really see,
    [G]All that I need to l[D]ook inside?
    [Em]Come to believe that I [C]better not leave,
    Be[G]fore I get my c[D]hance to ride.
[Em]    When it’s killing me, [C]what do I really need,

    [Em]Hey o[C]h,    [G]   listen wh[D]at I say[Em], oh.[C][G][D]
    Come back and, [Em]hey [C]oh,    [G]     look at wh[D]at I say[Em], oh.[C][G][D]



The [C]more I see, the less I know,
The more I like to let it go, [Em]hey [C]oh, oh oh oh.

[G]Deep beneath the cover of ano[D]ther perfect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Privately divided by a w[D]orld so undecided,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.
[G]In between the cover of an[D]other perfect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Running through the field where all my t[D]racks will be concealed,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.

[Em]    Now you bring it up, [C]I’m gonna ring it up,
    [G]Just to hear you s[D]ing it out.
    [Em]Step from the road to the [C]sea to the sky,
    And I [G]do believe what w[D]e rely on.
