    [Em]Step from the road to the [C]sea to the sky,

    [G]All that I need to l[D]ook inside?
    [Em]Come to believe that I [C]better not leave,

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,[/tab]
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Privately divided by a w[D]orld so undecided,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.
[G]In between the cover of an[D]other perfect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Running through the field where all my t[D]racks will be concealed,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.

    [G]Just to hear you s[D]ing it out.
    [Em]Step from the road to the [C]sea to the sky,
