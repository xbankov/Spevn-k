[Verse 1]



[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

    Come to decide that the things that I tried[/tab]
    Were [G]in my life just to get high[D] on.
[Em]    When I sit alone, come, get a[C] little known,
    [G]But I need more than myself this t[D]ime.
    [Em]Step from the road to the sea to the [C]sky,
    And I [G]do believe that we rely on.[D]
[Em]    When I lay it on, come, get [C]to play it on, all my life to sacrifi[G]ce.[D]

[tab]    [ch]Em[/ch]                      [ch]C[/ch]

    When will I know that I really can’t go[/tab]
    To the [G]well once more, time to decide o[D]n.
[Em]    When it’s killing me, when will r[C]eally see,
    [G]All that I need to look inside[D]?
    [Em]Come to believe that I better not [C]leave,
    Be[G]fore I get my chance to r[D]ide.
[Em]    When it’s killing me, what do I r[C]eally need,
    [G]All that I need to look inside[D]?

[tab]    [ch]C[/ch]

The more I see, the less I know,[/tab]
The more I like to let it go, [Em]hey oh, oh oh o[C]h.

[tab][ch]G[/ch]                           [ch]D[/ch]

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,[/tab]
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Privately divided by a world so un[D]decided,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.
[G]In between the cover of another perf[D]ect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Running through the field where all my tracks will[D] be concealed,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.

    All the [G]channels that have broken down[D].
[Em]    Now you bring it up, I’m gonna r[C]ing it up,
    [G]Just to hear you sing it out[D].
    [Em]Step from the road to the sea to the [C]sky,
